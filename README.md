## Raw Data Source
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
## Script
I create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1.Merges the training and the test sets,extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and create one data set, "fdata"
2.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
3.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject called "tidtdata.txt.
## Code Book
The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
